# Super-X XPath Query Generator

A Chrome extension that helps developers and testers generate and test XPath queries for web elements. The extension provides two modes of operation: a hover mode that shows XPath queries for elements under the cursor, and a manual query mode that highlights elements matching a custom XPath query.

## XPath Examples

Here are some useful XPath examples to try in the manual query mode:

- `//div` - All div elements
- `//div[@id='content']` - Div with ID "content"
- `//a[@href]` - All links with href attribute
- `//button[contains(text(), 'Submit')]` - Buttons containing the text "Submit"
- `//input[@type='text']` - All text input fields
- `//*[contains(@class, 'menu')]` - Elements with class containing "menu"
- `//div[position() <= 3]` - First three div elements

## Technical Details

The extension consists of:

- **content.js**: Main script that runs on web pages
- **popup.html/js**: User interface for the extension popup
- **styles.css**: Styling for the overlay panels and highlighting
- **manifest.json**: Extension configuration

The extension uses the browser's built-in XPath evaluation capabilities through `document.evaluate()`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Extension not working on some sites**: Some websites use Content Security Policy (CSP) that may block the extension. Try on different websites.
- **XPath query not matching expected elements**: Verify your XPath syntax and check for dynamic IDs or classes that might change.
- **Panel disappears when clicking elsewhere**: This is by design for the hover mode. Use the manual query mode for persistent queries.
